# 📂 List of Programs

### `1. question_1.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**: Program to divide two numbers.<br>
**📌 Description**: This program performs the division of two integers using a user-defined function. It includes a check to prevent division by zero.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept two integers (iNo1 and iNo2).
2. Check if the second number (iNo2) is zero.
   - If yes, return -1 as an error code.
3. Otherwise, perform division (iNo1 / iNo2).
4. Return the result.
5. Display the result in main().
Stop
```

### `2. question_2.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**: Program to print "Marvellous" 5 times on the screen.<br>
**📌 Description**: Uses a `for` loop to print the word "Marvellous" exactly five times.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Define a function Display().
2. Initialize a loop counter variable.
3. Run a loop from 1 to 5.
4. In each iteration, print "Marvellous".
5. Call Display() from main().

Stop
```

### `3. question_3.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**: Program to display numbers from 5 to 1.<br>
**📌 Description**: This program prints numbers in reverse order using a `while` loop.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Define a function Display().
2. Initialize a counter variable to 5.
3. While the counter is greater than or equal to 1:
   - Print the current value.
   - Decrease the counter by 1.
4. Call Display() from main().
Stop
```

### `4. question_4.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**: Program to check if a number is divisible by 5.<br>
**📌 Description**: Takes an integer input from the user and checks if it is divisible by 5 using the `modulus` operator.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Define constants TRUE = 1 and FALSE = -1.
2. Accept an integer input from the user.
3. In the Check() function:
   - If number % 5 == 0, return TRUE.
   - Else, return FALSE.
4. In main(), call Check() with user input.
5. Print appropriate message based on the result.
Stop
```

---

### `5. question_5.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**:  Program to print '*' symbol based on given number.<br>
**📌 Description**: Accepts a number and prints that many `*` symbols vertically.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Define a function Accept() that takes an integer.
2. Run a loop from 1 to the given number.
3. In each iteration, print "*".
4. In main(), call Accept() with a specified number.
Stop
```
