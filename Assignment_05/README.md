### `1. question_1.c`
📝 **Problem Statement**: Print $ * pattern N times based on user input.<br>
📌 **Description**: Accept a number from the user and display $ * repeatedly that many times using a for loop.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer `iNo` from the user.
2. Loop from 1 to `iNo`, and for each iteration, print "$ * ".
Stop

```

---

### `2. question_2.c`
📝 **Problem Statement**: Display numbers from 1 to N.<br>
📌 **Description**: Accept a number from the user and print all numbers from 1 to that number sequentially.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer `iNo` from the user.
2. Loop from 1 to `iNo`, printing each number.
Stop

```

---

### `3. question_3.c`
📝 **Problem Statement**: Print a number line from -N to N.<br>
📌 **Description**: Accept a number from the user and print the full number line from -iNo to iNo.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer `iNo` from the user.
2. Loop from `-iNo` to `iNo`, printing each number in the range.
Stop

```

---

### `4. question_4.c`
📝 **Problem Statement**: Display all odd numbers less than a given number.<br>
📌 **Description**: Accept a number from the user and print all odd numbers from 1 up to but not including that number.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer `iNo` from the user.
2. Loop from 1 to `iNo - 1`.
3. If a number is odd (`iCnt % 2 != 0`), print it.
Stop

```

---

### `5. question_5.c`
📝 **Problem Statement**: Print the first 5 multiples of a given number.<br>
📌 **Description**: Accept a number from the user and display its first 5 multiples.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer `iNo` from the user.
2. Loop from 1 to 5:
   a. Multiply `iNo` with the current loop counter.
   b. Print the result.
Stop

```
