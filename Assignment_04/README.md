# 📂 List of Programs

### `1. question_1.c`
📝 **Problem Statement**: Calculate and print the multiplication of all the factors of a given number.<br>
📌 **Description**: The program accepts an integer from the user and calculates the multiplication of all its factors.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer `iNo` from the user.
2. Initialize a counter `iCnt = 0` and a variable `iMult = 1` for multiplication.
3. Loop through numbers from 1 to `iNo`:
   a. If `iNo % iCnt == 0` (i.e., `iCnt` is a factor of `iNo`), multiply it to `iMult`.
4. Return the value of `iMult`, which is the multiplication of all factors.
Stop
```

### `2. question_2.c`
📝 **Problem Statement**: Display factors of a number in decreasing order.<br>
📌 **Description**: Accept a number and print its factors in decreasing order.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer `iNo` from the user.
2. Loop through all numbers from `iNo` down to `1`.
3. Print the number if it is a factor of `iNo`.
Stop

```

### `3. question_3.c`
📝 **Problem Statement**: Display non-factors of a number.<br>
📌 **Description**: Accept a number and print all numbers that are not factors of that number.


#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer `iNo` from the user.
2. Loop through all numbers from `1` to `iNo`.
3. Print the number if it is not a factor of `iNo`.
Stop

```

### `4. question_4.c`
📝 **Problem Statement**: Return the summation of all non-factors of a number.<br>
📌 **Description**: Accept a number and return the sum of all numbers that are not factors of the given

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer `iNo` from the user.
2. Loop through all numbers from `1` to `iNo`.
3. Sum the numbers that are not factors of `iNo`.
4. Return the sum.
Stop

```

---

### `5. question_5.c`
📝 **Problem Statement**: Return the difference between the summation of all factors and non-factors of a number.<br>
📌 **Description**: Accept a number and calculate the difference between the sum of its factors and non-factors.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer `iNo` from the user.
2. Calculate the summation of factors.
3. Calculate the summation of non-factors.
4. Return the difference between the two sums.
Stop

```
