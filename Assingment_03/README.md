### `1. question_1.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**: Accept a number from the user and print that many even numbers on the screen.<br>
**📌 Description**: This program accepts an integer and prints the first `N` even numbers using a `for` loop.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer iNo from the user.
2. If iNo <= 0, return.
3. Loop from 1 to iNo.
4. For each iteration, print iCnt * 2.
Stop
```

### `2. question_2.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**: Accept a number from the user and print its even factors.<br>
**📌 Description**: This program accepts an integer and prints all the even factors of that number using a loop.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
- Accept an integer iNo from the user.
- If iNo is negative, convert it to positive.
- Loop from 1 to iNo.
- If the current number divides iNo evenly and is even, print it.
Stop
```

### `3. question_3.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**: Accept a number from the user and print its even factors.<br>
**📌 Description**: Similar to `DisplayFactor.c`, this program prints all the even factors of a given number.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
- Accept an integer iNo from the user.
- Convert iNo to positive if it is negative.
- Loop from 1 to iNo.
- If the number is both a factor of iNo and even, print it.
