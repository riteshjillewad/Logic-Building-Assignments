# 📂 List of Programs

### `1. question_1.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**: Accept a number from the user and print that many even numbers on the screen.<br>
**📌 Description**: This program accepts an integer and prints the first `N` even numbers using a `for` loop.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer iNo from the user.
2. If iNo <= 0, return.
3. Loop from 1 to iNo.
4. For each iteration, print iCnt * 2.
Stop
```

### `2. question_2.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**: Accept a number from the user and print its even factors.<br>
**📌 Description**: This program accepts an integer and prints all the even factors of that number using a loop.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer iNo from the user.
2. If iNo is negative, convert it to positive.
3. Loop from 1 to iNo.
4. If the current number divides iNo evenly and is even, print it.
Stop
```

### `3. question_3.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**: Accept a number from the user and print its even factors.<br>
**📌 Description**: Similar to `DisplayFactor.c`, this program prints all the even factors of a given number.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept an integer iNo from the user.
2. Convert iNo to positive if it is negative.
3. Loop from 1 to iNo.
4. If the number is both a factor of iNo and even, print it.
Stop
```

### `4. question_4.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**: Accept one character from the user and convert it from lowercase to uppercase or vice versa.<br>
**📌 Description**: This program checks if a character is lowercase or uppercase and converts it using functions from `<ctype.h>`.

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept a character from the user.
2. If the character is lowercase, convert it to uppercase.
3. Else if the character is uppercase, convert it to lowercase.
4. If neither, print "Not an alphabet character."
Stop
```

---

### `5. question_5.c`
**📝 Problem Statement**: Accept one character from the user and check whether it is a vowel or not.<br>
**📌 Description**: This program uses a simple conditional check to determine if the character is a vowel (case-insensitive).

#### Algorithm
```
Start
1. Accept a character cChar from the user.
2. If cChar is 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' or uppercase versions, return TRUE.
3. Else, return FALSE.
4. Display appropriate message based on the result.
Stop
```
